                <h3>About Equine Myofunctional Therapy (EMT) </h3>
                <h4><em>What is Equine Myofunctional Therapy?</em></h4>

                <h4><em>How might EMT help my horse?</em></h4>
                <p>Benefits to the horse of EMT are similar to those for human athletes and include stimulating the healing processes of the horse to facilitate:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Relieving muscular discomfort</li>
                    <li>Improving circulation</li>
                    <li>Increased relaxation</li>
                    <li>Pain relief</li>
                    <li>Improved posture</li>

                <h3>About Saddle Fitting</h3>
                <h4><em>What is Saddle Fitting? What can I expect?</em></h4>
                <p>Saddle-fitting involves assessing your current saddle for your horse, how it fits and affects the comfort of horse and rider, considering the horse's physical conformation and querying any issues.</p>
                <p>Assessment determines any adjustments needed, for example widening the gullet or adding wool flocking. Alterations to saddle fit incur additional cost. </p>
                <p>Yvette can advise if your saddle cannot be adjusted enough to fit your horse.</p>
                <p>Please be prepared for your fitting with any saddles needing checking and adjustments nearby.</p>

                <h4><em>How might saddle fitting help my horse?</em></h4>
                <p>Benefits to the horse of saddle fitting can include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Relieving discomfort or potential injury from an incorrectly fitted saddle</li>
                    <li>Increased relaxation</li>
                    <li>Increased ability to accept ridden work and the distributed weight of the rider</li>
                    <li>Decreased anxiety when ridden</li>
                    <li>Increased performance due to more comfortable gear</li>
                    <li>Improved communication of seat aids.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Saddle fitting also benefits the rider by improving your balance, position in the saddle, weight distribution, effectiveness of aids and seated comfort.</p>

                <p> Bit-fitting assesses your current bit options for your horse, querying any issues, measuring the mouth, considering unique physical characteristics.</p>
                <p>This assessment helps to determine what bit mouthpiece might best suit your horse. You work your horse in various bits from Yvette's collection to help decide their preferred bit.</p>
                <p>If you have booked a ridden assessment, please have your horse tacked up and ready at the booking time.</p>
