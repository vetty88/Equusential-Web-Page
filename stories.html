            </h4>
            <p class="card-text">Duke is a long-term client of Equusential, owned by our sponsored rider Krystel! He was an original case study! Duke had suffered a serious floating accident months earlier and also had developed suspected stringhalt. He was a mess! It has been a long journey of dedication, care and commitment to get him to the blue-ribbon working condition of this past year. To learn more about Duke's despair to domination journey please see his blog post **coming soon!**</p>

              <a href="#">Squirrel</a>
            </h4>
            <p class="card-text">Yvette's own "heart horse" Squirrel is the reason that Equusential began. Squirrel was suffering significant back pain and associated muscle damage/ scarring. Undoing this damage and building Squirrel up to be better in health with each passing year is Yvette's key motivator. Squirrel's journey to a healthy back and updates on her progress can be found on our <a href url="./blog.html">blog</a>. Also check out our social media as she is a familiar face!</div>

              <a href="#">Rage</a>
            </h4>
            <p class="card-text">Rage is Krystel's number #1 horse. He became an Equusential client after developing long-term lameness, the origin unknown. In recent times Krystel has worked diligently with the massage and rehabilitation pogram that Yvette set, with outstanding results! This program focused particularly on strengthening his deep back and core muscles. To date he is now sound and well! Rage's full story is available on our blog (**coming soon**) and you will see this golden boy feature regularly on our Facebook page!</p>

              <a href="#">KitKat</a>
            </h4>
            <p class="card-text">KitKat became an Equusential client when she began pulling up lame in the hind leg, especially after jumping. At the time she was training for Stockman's Challenges. KitKat's owner, Kristen, saw that she was unsound and made the decision to pull her from competition and focus on rehabilitation. Following a massage and rehabilitation program set by Yvette that included polework and gradual building of tone and fitness from the 'ground-up' Kristen is now enjoying a sound and competitive KitKat who has resumed jumping with no soundess concerns!</p>
