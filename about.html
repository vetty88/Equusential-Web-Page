          <h3>About Bit Fitting</h3>
          <h4><em>What is Bit Fitting and what can I expect?</em></h4>
          <p> Bit Fitting involves assessing your current bit options for your horse, querying any issues. Measuring the horses mouth and assessing their unique physical characteristics of tongue, lower jaw ("bars") and lips.
            This assessment helps to determine what bit mouthpiece might best suit your horse. The horse is then ridden or handled in bit and bridle on the ground depending on the booking.</p>
          <p> The horse is assessed for preference of bit mouth pieces of a variety of brands and types of bits. The cheekpiece is also assessed to best suit the rider/handlers hands and skill level, as well as the horses preference for stability of the rein.
            If you have booked a ridden assessment, please have your horse tacked up and ready to ride in your usual gear at the start of the appointment.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <h4><em>How might bit fitting help my horse?</em></h4>
          <p>Benefits to the horse of bit fitting can include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Relieving discomfort or potential injury from the wrong size or type of bit</li>
            <li>Increased relaxation</li>
            <li>Increased ability to accept and take the bit in contact</li>
            <li>Decreased anxiety</li>
            <li>Increased performance due to more comfortable gear</li>
            <li>Improved communication of aids for stopping, turning etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Following a bit fitting Yvette will often recommend a style or type of bit available from the Bit Bank Australia range, if the owner does not already have a suitable bit in their collection. <br><br>
