                            <p>Following the massage, my next ride appeared to be better, at first I thought it was just me with hopeful delusions, but this week my mare has been more willing, less sluggish and travelling better with every ride until today, 6 days after her massage we had the best ride we’ve ever had! </p>
                            <p>She was soft, flexible and willing just like she used to be!! I have my girl back!! I would highly recommend Equusential massage to anyone and have now included massage in my regular care regimen, if one massage can make this much of a difference I can only imagine what regular massages will do for my horses wellbeing.</p>
                            <p>Added bonus, Equusential Massage is affordable and flexible and gave me suggestions of things I could do myself to help my girl maintain her recovery. I would 100% recommend this service!!</p>

EMT and rehabilitation has helped Bobby to grow his muscle back and be competitively sound! Bobby is Barb's horse. He became an Equusential client in winter 2020 when Barb had taken him on. Barb worked diligently, patiently and progressively from day dot to rehabilitate Bobby. This approach was multi-faceted and drew on Barb's years of experience and knowledge caring for and training horses. Regular massages and rehabilitation exercises were key to Bobby's recovery. Bobby became sound, happy and competitive! </p>

She benefited from a dedicated massage and rehab program and is now competitive and sound again! KitKat became an Equusential client when she began pulling up lame in the hind leg, especially after jumping. At the time she was training for Stockman's Challenges. KitKat's owner, Kristen, saw that she was unsound and made the decision to pull her from competition and focus on rehabilitation. Following a massage and rehabilitation program set by Yvette that included polework and gradual building of tone and fitness from the 'ground-up' Kristen is now enjoying a sound and competitive KitKat who has resumed jumping with no soundess concerns!</p>
