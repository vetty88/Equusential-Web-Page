                    <h3>About Bit Fitting</h3>
                    <h4><em>What is Bit Fitting and what can I expect?</em></h4>
                    <p> Bit Fitting involves assessing your current bit options for your horse, querying any issues. Measuring the horses mouth and assessing their unique physical characteristics of tongue, lower jaw ("bars") and lips.
                        This assessment helps to determine what bit mouthpiece might best suit your horse. The horse is then ridden or handled in bit and bridle on the ground depending on the booking.</p>
                    <p> The horse is assessed for preference of bit mouth pieces of a variety of brands and types of bits. The cheekpiece is also assessed to best suit the rider/handlers hands and skill level, as well as the horses preference for stability of the rein.
                        If you have booked a ridden assessment, please have your horse tacked up and ready to ride in your usual gear at the start of the appointment.
                    </p>

                            <p>Tess is a 16HH, 28 y.o Australian stockhorse mare. Tess is originally a farm horse but started doing HRCAV when Squirrel was on Maternity leave.. turns out she is very reliable and quite a handy jumper! </p>
                            <p>Ardilla is Squirrel's 5year old filly, she is about 15.2HH and seems to still be growing, she is registered partbred Andalusian. Her sire is the now deceased PRE stallion 'Alto Del Otono' of Fernbrook Andalusians in Warragul, Victoria. Ardilla is green broken and proving very quiet. She has attended a couple of shows, lessons, clinic and trail rides and takes everything in her stride!</p>
                            <p>Patrick is a 3 y.o Australian stockhorse gelding. What he lacks in height he makes up for in personality! He is actually Tess's nephew and was purchased from the Ashlyn Study in Cooma NSW. Patrick has attended some led shows and will commence his riding career early this year!</p>
                            <p>Our horses love and benefit from regular massages. They are thriving from an all-round approach to care and management</p>
